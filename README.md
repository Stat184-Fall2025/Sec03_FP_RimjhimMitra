# The Effect of Foreign Aid on Economic Development in Developing Countries

This repo is for the STAT 184 final project.

## Overview

The primary purpose of this project is to investigate whether foreign aid has a statistically significant, positive economic development in developing countries. The significance of this is to see if assistance is genuinely beneficial in the long-term economic development of a country. This is going to be done using multivariate regression models. 

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

The data from this project was obtained from the World Bank database (specifically the https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators). 

## Current Plan

Currently, this project aims to build regression models to see what factors influence foreign aid--ultimately answering the question, does foreign aid help economic development?
